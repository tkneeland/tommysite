Hi! I'm Tommy, nice to meet you. I'm a WPI alum class of '24, with a BS in Computer Science as well as
a BA in Music. I've been in Massachussetts all my life, raised in Sudbury. However, I've officially started
my next chapter in Schenectady NY to become an Associate Software Engineer at Jahnel Group! 


When I'm not happily working in the Jahnel Group office,
 you would most likely find me playing some funky music at local venues. Gonna try
 to break into the Schenectady music scene very soon! I'm a horn player by trade- 
 mainly trumpet and trombone, but other instruments such as F horn and tuba too.
 
 I also write/record my own original music, and am planning to release projects to streaming
 services soon as well! My favorite genres to play, listen to, & write are funk, jazz, RnB, and indie.

 Most of my free time is spent on music but I also enjoy board games, cooking, playing tennis, and hiking/camping!
